cadCAD is a differential games based simulation software package for research, validation, and     Computer Aided Design of economic systems. An economic system is treated as a state based model and defined through     a set of endogenous and exogenous state variables which are updated through mechanisms and environmental processes,     respectively. Behavioral models, which may be deterministic or stochastic, provide the evolution of the system     within the action space of the mechanisms. Mathematical formulations of these economic games treat agent utility as     derived from state rather than direct from action, creating a rich dynamic modeling framework. Simulations may be     run with a range of initial conditions and parameters for states, behaviors, mechanisms, and environmental     processes to understand and visualize network behavior under various conditions. Support for A/B testing policies,     monte carlo analysis and other common numerical methods is provided.
